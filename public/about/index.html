    <p> <b> Who the heck is this guy? </b> My name is Jordan, otherwise known as thedevbones. I am 21 years old and a university student studying computer science. 
      My goal is to make fun games, hopefully one day for a living. I owe a huge thanks to games like LittleBigPlanet and Dark Cloud that inspired me in my early life.</p>
    <br>
    <p> <b>What does this guy do? </b> Over the past 10 years I've created many small game projects in Game Maker 6.1 and Game Maker Studio which I hope never see the light of day. 
      As of early 2024, I have been teaching myself Godot through several personal projects and prototypes. Thanks to my university learning, using GDScript has been a blast. 
      I have also been using Blender as a way to create "programmer art" that meets my retro, low-poly aesthetic. <p>
    <br>
    <p> If you have any questions are comments about my projects, or simply wish to reach out, please feel free to email me or message me on Discord.</p>
