    <h3>Who is this guy?</h3>
    <p> My name is Jordan, otherwise known as thedevbones. I am 22 years old who recently graduated from Texas State University with a Bachelors in Computer Science. 
      My goal is to make fun games, hopefully one day for a living.</p>
    <br> <br>
    <h3>What do you do?</h3>
    <p> As of early 2024, I have been teaching myself Godot through several personal projects, one of which is nearing completion
      I've been learning Unity as part of my internship at <a href="https://www.froglet.games/">Froglet Games</a>, where I am working on their title <em>Cosmic Shore</em>.
      On the side, I have been using Blender as a way to create some programmer art that meets my retro, low-poly aesthetic. <p>
